# Getting Started
This is a To-Do list app created with the PyQt5 Python package. After downloading all the repository files, run the **main.py** file to start the app.

A login window is shown on startup, prompting the user for a username and password, with an option given to create a new account. 

Upon logging in, the main app window is shown. Here, the user is given four options:
- **Add item** 
    - adds the item provided by the user in the input bar
- **Delete item**
    - deletes a selected row in the to-do list
- **Clear list**
    - clears all items in the list
- **Save list**
    - saves all items in the list to an SQLite3 database 
    - creates a separate database for each user
- **Logout**
    - returns user to login window
